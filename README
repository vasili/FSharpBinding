I. This version of the FSharpBinding now supports mapping an error to the corresponding line in 
   the source code. The starting point was the CSharpBinding source. I somewhat naive approach was
   adopted in adapting the CSharpBinding to the FSharp environment. Hence, there is most likely much
   to do to finish implement the FSharpBinding correctly! On a somewhat more positive note, the FSharp 
   binding was tested with small F# test programs and also tested with existing F# projects downloaded
   from the Web.
